						<p>Hey there!</p>

                 		<p>Thanks for stopping by and taking some time to learn more about me. My name is Laura (but you can call me Lau) and I'm currently a senior product designer at Kantox.</p>

                 		<p>Strange as it may seem, I started my career as a designer after graduating from physics at Universitat de Barcelona and working as a SAP developer. I studied graphic design at BAU while I worked as a graphic design intern for a few companies to specialise afterwards as a UI/UX designer.</p>

                 		<p>I enjoy working with platforms that have complex interfaces and user flows, always trying to get an understanding of their ins and outs. I feel at peace when I'm able to comprehend the reasoning behind every decision and I'm able to put all the pieces together to find ways to improve a product.</p>

                 		<p>Outside of work, you'll find me studying Japanese (日本語の二年生です！), playing video games, watching anime, reading manga, taking care of my plants or taking a stroll. Ah, yes, sometimes I draw too.</p>

                 		<p>Want to collaborate? Do a plant swap? Play FFXIV together? Hit me up!</p>
